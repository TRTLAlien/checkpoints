# Checkpoints
### How To Sync Quickly
##### Using Checkpoints

In versions 0.4.3+ you can sync a fresh chain from block 0 much quicker by using checkpoints. Follow [this guide](Checkpoints.md) to find out how

### Setup

- Right click [this link](https://github.com/turtlecoin/checkpoints/raw/master/checkpoints.csv) and choose `Save link as...` to download the latest checkpoints.csv.
- Place checkpoints.csv in the same folder as your TurtleCoind daemon
- You can get TurtleCoind from here if you don't have it already: https://latest.turtlecoin.lol
- Make sure you shut down any GUI wallets, or any other instances of TurtleCoind.

### Usage

#### Windows

- First, open a command prompt in the same directory as TurtleCoind.
- This can easily be done by moving to the TurtleCoind directory in Windows Explorer, then typing `cmd` in the search bar and hitting enter:

- Finally, type `TurtleCoind.exe --load-checkpoints checkpoints.csv` in the command prompt.

#### Linux, Apple

- First, open a command prompt in the same directory as TurtleCoind.
- You can use the `cd` command to change to this directory. For example, `cd Downloads/turtlecoin-v0.5.0`
- Alternatively, your file manager may provide the ability to open a terminal in your current directory. Navigate to the folder with TurtleCoind in, and try right clicking, to see if you can open a terminal there:

- Finally, type `./TurtleCoind --load-checkpoints checkpoints.csv` in the terminal.

### Expected Output

If you did the steps correctly, you should see something like this output.

```
2018-May-13 11:58:39.654478 INFO    Welcome to TurtleCoin v0.5.0.1260 ()
2018-May-13 11:58:39.654914 INFO    Module folder: TurtleCoind
2018-May-13 11:58:39.655249 INFO    Loading Checkpoints for faster initial sync...
2018-May-13 11:58:40.854979 INFO    Loaded 435695 checkpoints from checkpoints.csv
```

- TurtleCoind will then start syncing from checkpoints.
- If you are using the CLI wallet, then you can just wait for it to finish syncing, and open your wallet.
- If you are using a GUI wallet, let it finish syncing, close it down by typing `exit` in the window, then open your GUI wallet.
